# Inspiration

Our inspiration was the HackBeanPot theme this year! And wanting to make learning fun and interactive.

# What it does

Our goal was to create a game that while speeding past asteroids, you learned about the different asteroids, comets, planets, and stars that you saw and gave good and factual information about them. And then at the end you find about the comet that hit Earth along with some fun Dino facts!

# How we built it

We built it with Unity and C#!

# Challenges we ran into

We chose this project to do in unity because none of us has ever used it before, so it was a HUGE challenge not only because we were knew to Unity and game development and hackathons in general, but also because Unity is a massive system to learn that we even when working with amazing mentors we had loads of difficulties trying to get the scripts to load, even to just make the background infinite was a hassle! One of the biggest problems was using Unity Collaborate and allowing access to other team members which slowed us down significantly.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud to have made the game. To learn about colliders and rigid bodies, to have made an infinite background, and to have a start page that leads to the game. Everything was so difficult so every little thing was so important.

# What we learned

We learned that we definitely need more expertise, but it was a fun challenge!

# What's next for Meteor Mania

We want to implement the entirety of the game!
